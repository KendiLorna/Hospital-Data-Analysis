# Hospital-Data-Analysis
An analysis of hospital data using SQL and Tableau.

## OVERVIEW

The project uses hospital data containing five tables: patient, doctor, appointment, billing, and medical procedure.

### OBJECTIVE

There are a few questions I aimed to answer from the analysis:

1. What trends are observed in the appointment dates? and are there specific times of the year when appointments peak?

2. Which doctors handle the most appointments and is there a correlation between a doctor's specialization and the billing amount?

3. Which medical procedures are most frequently performed? Is there a particular specialization associated with the procedures? 

4. What is the distribution of billing amounts?

5. How does the total billing amount vary by doctor specialization?

### DATA

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle
[Healthcare management dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anouskaabhisikta/healthcare-management-system/data)

### TOOLS

MySQL and Tableau Public

### DATA CLEANING
- Concatenated two columns to create the email address column and dropped the irrelevant column from the doctor table.

````
  CREATE TABLE doctor_copy
(DoctorID INT,
DoctorName TEXT,
Specialization TEXT,
DoctorContact TEXT,
Email VARCHAR(250)
);
````
````
INSERT INTO doctor_copy 
SELECT * FROM doctor;
````
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
````
UPDATE doctor_copy 
SET Email = CONCAT(DoctorName, DoctorContact);
````
````
ALTER TABLE doctor_copy
DROP COLUMN DoctorContact;
````
- Concatenated two columns - the first and last name to create a name column in the patient table.

````
ALTER TABLE patient
ADD COLUMN Patientname VARCHAR(250) AFTER lastname;

UPDATE patient
SET Patientname = concat(firstname," ",lastname);

ALTER TABLE patient
DROP COLUMN lastname ;

````
- Renamed the medical procedure column to medical_procedure for ease of use.

````
RENAME TABLE `medical procedure` TO medical_procedure;
````
- Found and replaced 22 unnamed items with NULL on the billing table to exclude them from the analysis.

````
SELECT *
FROM billing
WHERE NULLIF(Items, '') IS NULL;

UPDATE billing
SET Items = Null
WHERE NULLIF(Items, '') IS NULL;

### DATA VISUALISATION

![Hospital data analysis dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b3d72e9-bd53-4129-93ba-888fc145c253)

### INSIGHTS

1. Appointments distribution:

November is the peak month and Thursday is the peak day, whereas October and February are the least popular months for appointments.

2. Doctor Performance:

Radiologists handle the most number of appointments overall and geriatric specialists the least.
There isnâ€™t a discernible pattern in specialty and billing, but the top two doctors are critical care specialists tied at $ 20,776,809.
17 is the highest number of observed appointments per doctor while 1 is the lowest at an average of 4 per doctor.
Oncology has the highest number of specialists at 54 and Hospice and Palliative care has the lowest at 26.

3. Procedure Popularity:

Insulin pump management is the most popular with 25 cases, and the highest revenue at $14,083,138.
X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans are the highest number of billed items which corresponds to the number of radiology appointments.

4. Billing Analysis:

The top-performing doctors per specialty are outliers contributing to raising the average billing rate per specialization,
and as a result, most other doctors in the category bill below average.
Critical care and psychiatry have the top-billing doctors, while ophthalmology and infectious diseases are the bottom two.

### RECOMMENDATION 

1. The number of appointments by specialization can inform disease and condition trends over time.

2. Specializations' staffing can be restructured based on billing, procedures, and appointments.

3. The most common procedures can be used to predict patient needs and to inform public health awareness.

4. The top billing doctors can be investigated further to see if they are outliers in their categories or if there are discrepancies in remuneration.

5. A review of doctors with below-average appointments can be done to determine if patient demand or doctor performance is the problem.
