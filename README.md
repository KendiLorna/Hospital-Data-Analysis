# Hospital-Data-Analysis
An analysis of hospital data using SQL and Microsoft Power BI.

## OVERVIEW

The project uses hospital data containing five tables: patient, doctor, appointment, billing, and medical procedure.
The data was cleaned and explored in MySQL before visualizing it in Microsoft Power BI.

### OBJECTIVE

There are a few questions I aimed to answer from the analysis:

1. What trends are observed in the appointment dates? and are there specific times of the year when appointments peak?

2. What is the distribution of doctors per specialty and is there a correlation between a doctor's specialization and the billing amount?

3. Which medical procedures are most frequently performed? Is there a particular specialization associated with the procedures? 

4. How does the total billing amount vary by doctor specialization?

### DATA

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle
[Healthcare management dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anouskaabhisikta/healthcare-management-system/data)

### TOOLS

MySQL and Microsoft Power BI

### DATA CLEANING
- Concatenated two columns to create the email address column and dropped the irrelevant column from the doctor table.

````
  CREATE TABLE doctor_copy
(DoctorID INT,
DoctorName TEXT,
Specialization TEXT,
DoctorContact TEXT,
Email VARCHAR(250)
);
````
````
INSERT INTO doctor_copy 
SELECT * FROM doctor;
````
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
````
UPDATE doctor_copy 
SET Email = CONCAT(DoctorName, DoctorContact);
````
````
ALTER TABLE doctor_copy
DROP COLUMN DoctorContact;
````
- Concatenated two columns - the first and last name to create a name column in the patient table.

````
ALTER TABLE patient
ADD COLUMN Patientname VARCHAR(250) AFTER lastname;

UPDATE patient
SET Patientname = concat(firstname," ",lastname);

ALTER TABLE patient
DROP COLUMN lastname ;

````
- Renamed the medical procedure column to medical_procedure for ease of use.

````
RENAME TABLE `medical procedure` TO medical_procedure;
````
- Found and dropped 22 unclassified items on the billing table to exclude them from the analysis.

````
SELECT *
FROM billing
WHERE NULLIF(Items, '') IS NULL;

UPDATE billing
SET Items = Null
WHERE NULLIF(Items, '') IS NULL;

DELETE FROM  billing 
WHERE ITEMS ="Null";

### DATA VISUALISATION

![Hospital data analysis dashboard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b3d72e9-bd53-4129-93ba-888fc145c253)

### INSIGHTS

1. Appointments distribution:

- January and April are tied as the peak months and Friday is the peak day overall, whereas March and Saturday are the least
popular month and day for appointments respectively.

2. Doctor Performance:

- Radiologists handle the most number of appointments overall which corresponds to a high count of  X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans.

![Specialization and appointments](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcc88d74-3ff3-400e-8c6d-72cf713bad59)

- There isnâ€™t a discernible pattern in specialty and billing, but the top two doctors are critical care specialists tied at $ 20,776,809.

- 17 is the highest number of observed appointments per doctor while 1 is the lowest at an average of 4 per doctor.

![Appointments per doctor](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2f6e851-e9e3-40b6-8c0d-a106b3c00aad)

- Oncology has the highest number of specialists at 54 and Hospice and Palliative care has the lowest at 26.

![Count of doctors by specialization](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3561b44c-48dd-4b84-aa92-1461c8602382)

3. Procedure Popularity:

- Insulin pump management is the most popular with 25 cases, and the highest revenue at $14,083,138.

![Items count and revenue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/169c30ed-cfd6-464f-b272-222592468f52)

- X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans are the items that are the most billed, corresponding to the number of radiology appointments.
 ![Procedures count](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8aacc2-ba24-4ea3-9b57-445554b2c929)

4. Billing Analysis:

- The top-performing doctors per specialty are outliers in their categories contributing to raising the average billing rate per specialization,
As a result, most other doctors in the category bill below average.

- Critical care and psychiatry have the top-billing doctors, while ophthalmology and infectious diseases are the bottom two.

### RECOMMENDATION 

1. The number of appointments by specialization can inform disease and condition trends over time.

2. Specializations' staffing can be restructured based on billing, procedures, and appointments.

3. The most common procedures can be used to predict patient needs and to inform public health awareness.

4. The top billing doctors can be investigated further to see if they are outliers in their categories or if there are discrepancies in remuneration.

5. A review of doctors with below-average appointments can be done to determine if patient demand or doctor performance is the problem.
